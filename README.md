# Talking mind

Project live link (https://talking-mind-firebase.web.app/)

- I have a services page in this project which has 3 services. Anyone can buy a service from here and consult a doctor.
- However, there are some authentications, such as if someone buys the service, he can not buy without a login account
- There is an about page with details about what my goal is and what I want to do
- In it I have used Google firebase for authentication
- I use the hero icon for the icon, and use the toast for the user to show when the error occurs and when all the success is in the form of all alerts.
